# Multi-Ancestry Trait Prediction -  an extension of the work on Thursday

## Task – PRS calculation in multiple populations [3.5 hrs]
Thursday’s practical will focus on getting you up and running with some of the leading software tools for performing PRS calculation across ancestries.  
* Then we will allow you to adapt the scripts that we will provide you with, in order to complete the practical that we will set for you.      
* You’ll be doing the practical in the groups that you were assigned to at the beginning of the week and at the end of the practical (on Friday) each group will give a presentation about your work and your findings      
* For the project there will be a total of 5 populations to choose from, namely East Asian, European, South Asian, Amerindian, African (EAS, EUR, SAS, AMR and AFR). Each group will choose a combination of two populations, which have been simulated to have the same genetic architecture but with a different LD structure and allele frequencies.      
* Using the methods you will learn during the day 4 practical (and potentially other skills learned throughout this week) you will evaluate the performance of at least one of the multi-ancestry methods you will learn about tomorrow and compare this against the performance of PRSice, (a tool which hasn’t been designed for multi-ancestry purposes).
