## Exercise 1 Estimating R<sup>2</sup> in case and control studies
Bias in R<sup>2</sup> estimation caused by ascertained case/control samples can be adjusted using the equation proposed by **Lee et al (2011)**, which requires the sample prevalence (case/control ratio) and population prevalence as parameters. This function is implemented in PRSice and the adjustment can be performed by providing the population prevalence to the command **--prevalence**.

Residuals of logistic regression is not well defined, and in PRS analyses, Nagelkerke R<sup>2</sup> is usually used to represent the model R<sup>2</sup> (this is the default of PRSice). However, this R<sup>2</sup> does not account for the diÔ¨Äerence between sample prevalence (i.e. case-control ratio) and population prevalence, which can lead to bias in the reported R<sup>2</sup> (Figure 1.1a).

Bias in R<sup>2</sup> estimation caused by ascertained case/control samples can be adjusted using the equation proposed by **Lee et al. 2011 (Figure 1.1b)**, which requires the sample
prevalence (case/control ratio) and population prevalence as parameters. This function is implemented in PRSice and the adjustment can be performed by providing the population prevalence to the command **--prevalence**.

---


Now, account for the ascertainment of the case/control sample by including the population prevalence (let‚Äôs assume e.g. 5% here) in the PRSice command to obtain the adjusted (Lee) R<sup>2</sup> :

```
Rscript ./Software/PRSice.R \
--prsice Software/PRSice_linux \
--base  Base_Data/cad.add.txt \
--target Target_Data/TAR \
--snp markername \
--A1 effect_allele \
--A2 noneffect_allele \
--chr chr \
--bp bp_hg19 \
--stat beta \
--beta \
--pvalue p_dgc \
--pheno Target_Data/TAR.cad \
--prevalence 0.05 \ 
--binary-target T \
--out Results/CAD.highres.LEER2
```
The results are written to the "Results" directory. Examine the results folder and each file that was generated. For more information about each file type, see  [here](https://choishingwan.github.io/PRSice/step_by_step/).

## Exercise 2 Overfitting caused by model optimisation

In PRS analyses, the shrinkage or tuning parameter is usually optimized across a wide range of parametric space (e.g. P -value threshold, proportion of causal SNPs). When both optimisation and association testing are performed on the target data, over-fitted results will be obtained. The accuracy and predictive power of over-fitted results are likely to diminish when replicated in an independent data set.

A simple solution is to perform permutation to obtain an empirical P -value for the association model, which is implemented in PRSice. Briefly, permutation is performed as follows:
1) Compute the P -value in your original data, denoted as obs.p, at the "best" threshold.
2) Then shuÔ¨Ñe the phenotype and obtain the P -value of the "best" threshold for this null phenotype, denoted as null.p
3) Repeat 2) N times
4) Calculate the empirical P-value as:

 $` Pemp = (\sum(obs.p > null.pi + 1) / (N + 1) `$
---

You will have to specify the number of permutation (N ) to perform by providing --perm N as a parameter to PRSice.

```
Rscript ./Software/PRSice.R \
    --prsice Software/PRSice_linux \

### Out of Sample Validation

The best way to avoid having results that are over-fit is to perform validation on an independent validation data set. We can perform validation of the previous height + covariate analysis with PRSice, using the independent VAL target sample as validation data and the "best" P-value threshold predicted in the VAL samples:

```
Rscript ./Software/PRSice.R \
    --prsice Software/PRSice_linux \
    --base  Base_Data/GIANT_Height.txt \
    --target Target_Data/VAL \
    --snp MarkerName \
    --A1 Allele1 \
    --A2 Allele2 \
    --stat b \
    --beta \
    --pvalue p \
    --pheno Target_Data/VAL.height \
    --binary-target F \
    --no-full \
    --bar-levels 0.0680001 \
    --fastscore \
    --cov Target_Data/VAL.covariate \
    --cov-col Sex \
    --out Results/Height.val
```

## Exercise 3 Distribution of PRS

Many PRS study publications include quantile plots that show an exponential increase in phenotypic value or / Odd Ratios (OR) among the top quantiles (e.g. an S-shaped quantile plot, e.g. Figure 1.6). 
>
  **Figure 1.5: An example of density plot for PRS**
>
![Figure 1.5](/images/day3/images020.png)
---
>
  **Figure 1.6: An example of a S-shaped quantile plot**
>
![Figure 1.6](/images/day3/images021.png)
---

This might lead us to believe that individuals with PRS values in the top quantiles have a distinctly diÔ¨Äerent genetic aetiology compared to the rest of the sample, or that there is epistasis/interactions causing there substantially higher risk. However, when we plot a normally distributed variable (e.g. a PRS) as quantiles on the X-axis then we expect to observe this exponential pattern even when the X variable only has a linear eÔ¨Äect on the Y variable. This is because the top (and bottom) quantiles are further away from each other on the absolute scale of the variable and so the diÔ¨Äerences in their eÔ¨Äects are larger than between quantiles in the middle of the distribution.

To understand this more, we will perform a simple simulation using R:
```
R
# First, we define some simulation parameters
n.sample <- 10000
PRS.r2 <- 0.01
# Then, we simulate PRS that follow a random normal distribution
prs <- rnorm(n.sample)
# We can then simulate the phenotype using the following script
pheno <- prs + rnorm(n.sample,mean=0, sd=sqrt(var(prs)*(1-PRS.r2)/(PRS.r2)))
# We can examine the relationship between the phenotype and prs 
# using linear regression
summary(lm(pheno~prs))
# Which shows that we have the expected PRS R2
# Group the phenotype and PRS into a data.frame
info <- data.frame(SampleID=1:n.sample, PRS=prs, Phenotype=pheno)
# Then we can generate the quantile plot. 
# To save time, we will load in the quantile plot script from Software
source("./Software/Quantile.R")
# Then we can plot the quantile plot using quantile_plot function
quantile_plot(info, "Results/Height", 100)
```

## Gene Set Analysis
Currently, most PRS analyses have been performed on a genome-wide scale, disregarding the underlying biological pathways. Udler et al. 2018 suggest that grouping Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) into biological functional groups can lead to PRS that are more relevant to clinical risk. In this practical, we will go through some common file formats for gene-set analysis and will then calculate some gene-set (or pathway) based PRS.

### Molecular Signatures Database MSigDB
The Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) oÔ¨Äers an excellent source of gene-sets, including the hallmark genes, gene-sets of diÔ¨Äerent biological processes, gene-sets of diÔ¨Äerent oncogenic signatures etc. All gene-sets from MSigDB follows the Gene Matrix Transposed file format (GMT), which consists of one line per gene-set, each containing at least 3 column of data:

| | | | | |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Set A| Description | Gene 1 | Gene 2 | ...
|Set A| Description | Gene 1 | Gene 2 | ...

---
> ** Have a look at the Reference/Sets.gmt file. **
>
> ‚ùì How many gene-sets are there in the Reference/Sets.gmt file? 
>
> ‚ùì How many genes does the largest gene-set contain?
>
---
>
> üí¨ While you can read the GMT file using Excel. You should be aware that Excel has a tendency to convert gene names into dates (e.g. SEPT9 to Sep-9)
>
---

As GMT format does not contain the chromosomal location for each individual gene, an additional file is required to provide the chromosoaml location such that SNPs can be map to genes.

### General Transfer Format file
The General Transfer Format (GTF) file contains the chromosomal coordinates for each gene. It is a **tab** separated file and all but the final field in each feature line must contain a value. "Empty" columns should be denoted with a ‚Äò.‚Äô. You can read the full format specification here. One column that might be of particular interest is column 3: **feature**, which indicates what feature that line of GTF represents. This allows us to select or ignore features that are of interest.

You can find the description of each feature [here](http://www.sequenceontology.org/browser/obob.cgi).


### Browser Extensible Data BED
Browser Extensible Data (BED) file (diÔ¨Äerent to the binary ped file from PLINK) is a file format to define genetic regions. It contains 3 required fields per line (chromosome, start coordinate and end coordinate) together with 9 additional optional field. A special property of BED is that it is a 0-based format, i.e. chromosome starts at 0, as opposed to the usual 1-based format such as the PLINK format. For example, a SNP on chr1:10000 will be represented as:

| | | |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|**1**|**9999**|**10000**|

## Gene Set Enrichment Analysis

Now we have gone through all the files involved in gene-set analysis, we should consider one of the most important aspects of gene-set (or pathway) enrichment
analyses, which is the diÔ¨Äerent types of testing that we can perform when doing them:

### Self-Contained vs Competitive Testing
The null-hypothesis of self-contained and competitive test statistics is diÔ¨Äerent:
  ‚Äì **Self-Contained** - None of the genes within the gene-set are associated with the phenotype
  ‚Äì **Competitive** - Genes within the gene-set are no more associated with the phenotype than genes outside the gene-set
Therefore, a bigger gene-set will have a higher likelihood of having a significant P -value from self-contained test, which is not desirable.


## Exercise 4 Gene Set Based PRS Analysis

Having learnt about the basics of gene-set analyses, we are now ready to perform gene-set association analyses using PRSet.

To perform the PRSet analysis and obtain the set based PRS and competitive P-value, simply provide the GTF file and the GMT file to PRSice and specify the number of permutation for competitive P-value calculation using the --set-perm option.

```
Rscript ./Software/PRSice.R \
    --prsice Software/PRSice_linux  \
    --base Base_Data/GIANT_Height.txt \
    --target Target_Data/TAR \
    --A1 Allele1 \
    --A2 Allele2 \
    --snp MarkerName \
    --pvalue p \
    --stat b \
    --beta \
    --binary-target F \
    --pheno Target_Data/TAR.height \
    --cov Target_Data/TAR.covariate \
    --out Results/Height.set \
    --gtf Reference/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.86.gtf \
    --wind-5 5kb \
    --wind-3 1kb \
    --msigdb Reference/Sets.gmt \
    --multi-plot 10 \
    --set-perm 1000
```

---
>
> üìå If the --wind-5 and --wind-3 flag is not specified, PRSet will use the exact coordinates of each gene as the boundary. By specifying eg. --wind-5 5kb and --wind-3 1kb then the boundary of each gene will be extended 5 kb towards the 5‚Äô end and 1 kb towards the 3‚Äô end so that regulatory elements of the gene can be included.
>
> üìç By default, when calculating set based PRS, PRSet will not perform P -value thresholding. This is because the aim in gene-set analyses is to assess the overall signal in each gene-set, and compare which is most enriched for signal, rather than optimise predictive power as typically desirable for genome-wide PRS. Providing any of the following commands will activate P -value thresholding for set based PRS calculation: --lower, --upper, --inter, --bar-levels, --fastscore
