# Integration of Polygenic Risk Scores

## Task â€“ PRSmix calculation [3.5 hrs]
 
You have just completed the Wellcome Connecting Science PRS course and are now acquainted with tools such as PRSCSx and BRIDGEPRS. You also got to hear a talk by Prof Nilanjan Chatterjee, who you later realized has been involved in developing three latest PRS software programs, PROSPER, MUSSEL, and CT-SLEB, that claim to improve PRS prediction in Africans. You are now getting overwhelmed by the sheer number of tools to test out and do not know which tool to use for your PRS project, which involves continental Africans. You decide to read more, and you then stumble across a novel approach called PRSmix, which integrates PRSs developed using diverse methods, forming an integrated PRS that has been noted to outperform previously reported PRS, as shown below. This seems as a much more pragmatic approach, and you are eager to apply it to your PRS projects.

* Qn1. May you outline the steps (analysis plan) that you will follow to apply the PRSmix approach to the trait you have been assigned. Indicate the metrics you will use to evaluate the predictivity of the PRS for the trait you have been assigned?
* Qn2. You have been given 15 to 23 PRSs, phenotype, age, sex and PCs depending on your group data files. May you implement your analysis plan and illustrate the codes and outputs that you will share in the form of an Rmarkdown file . May plot the predictivity of the PRSmix vs other PGS in your data file?
* Qn3. State the pros and cons of using the PRSmix approach in continental Africans?
