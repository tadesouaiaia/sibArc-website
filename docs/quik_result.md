    Notice:  
    1. Evidence of De Novo architecture in both trait tails.                                                                                                                                                                             
    2. Lower heritability in both trait tails.

    Notice:  
    1. Polygenic architecture in the lower tail, Mendelian heritability in the upper tail.                                                                                                                                                                             
    2. Increased heritability in the upper tail.
